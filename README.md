# FlameWok

_Very tiny framework project to build quickly python apps running
ONLY in terminal._

The purpose of this package is to get you rid as much as possible 
of the tedious part of creating menus and forms, and help to keep
the code clean.

Fully functionnal now. Works great !


## Create forms
```python
from flamewok import Form

my_form = Form()
```
## Create menus : 
```python
from flamewok import Menu

my_menu = Menu()
```

yes, that simple.

check the exemples to get an idea.
