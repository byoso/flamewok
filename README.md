Very tiny framework project to build quickly python apps running
ONLY in terminal.

It is still a work in progress:

Done:
    - Form class
    - Menu class


TODO:
    - Handler class (to handle the signals emmited from menus in a 
    convenient way)
    - integrate a small DB working with json (tinyDB maybe ?, or else)
