                FlameWok

Very tiny framework project to build quickly python apps running
ONLY in terminal.

The purpose of this package is to get you rid as much as possible 
of the tedious part of creating menus and forms, and help to keep
the code clean.

Fully functionnal now. Works great !

you want to create forms ?
-> from flamewok import Form
you want to create menus ?
-> from flamewok import Menu

yes, that simple.

check the exemples to get an idea.
