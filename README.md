                FlameWok

Very tiny framework project to build quickly python apps running
ONLY in terminal.

(It is still a work in progress)

you want to create forms ?
-> from flamewok import Form
you want to create menus ?
-> from flamewok import Menu

yes, that simple.

check the exemples to get an idea.

TODO next:
    - insert/remove menu elements
