                        USING THE FORM CLASS

START WITH FORMS

first, import the Form class:
from flamewok import Form

create a form:
form = Form([
        < some tuples >,
        ...    
    ])

the tuples must be constructed like this:
(str(the attribute used to gather the data), str(a text to display before the prompt))


display the form and gather datas:
response = form.ask()

The response obtained is an object Response, that have the attributes set in the tuples given at the form creation.
The data gathered is now accessible doing:
my_data = response.attribute

(Basic python tip: you can convert it to a dict doing: my_dictionnary = response.__dict__)


MANIPULATING A FORM

A Form have fields (class Field) stored in the list Form.fields, it can then be used as any list, to 
insert/remove/append/etc... some Fields objects in it.


FIELDS

The class Field can be imported: from flamewok import Field

create a Field:
field = Field(str(name), str(label))
